# NeoPixel Matrix Full V:1.0.0 Rev:1.2
The present code is to control a matrix of Neopixels WS28... with the ESP32, This library uses the Library "Adafruit_NeoPixel.h" as a Base, but then I create own functions to improve the way we control the matrix and to have good and nice animations and so.
It also has some examples from "Hello World" to works with APIs.
