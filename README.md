# NeoPixel Matrix Full

Release Version : 1.0.0
Revision        : 1.3

The present code is to control a matrix of Neopixels WS28... with the ESP32 and arduino as a Framework, This library uses the Library "Adafruit_NeoPixel.h" as a Base, but then I create own functions to improve the way we control the matrix to have nice animations and so.
It also has some examples from "Hello World" to works with APIs.

## Main Indications

- The project is ready to pull in Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO as a plugin.
- The control Pin as default is GPIO4 (Is possible to change in the declarations)
- The Matrix tested is an array of 32*8 NeoLeds
